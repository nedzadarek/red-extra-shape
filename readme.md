# Extra-shape

## Description:
Allows you to execute and define functions that returns the draw dialect's code. Codes should run independly (more later) so you should be able to change some parameters without affecting other code (for example draw 3 boxes with a different color as in the last example).

## Examples:
See [example.red](/example.red).

## Independent code:
I am putting your code into a `push` block. Check [this documenation](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/draw.adoc#push). I am assuming that the `push` is "good enough". If you think you need something else then consider suggesting some change directly into `push`.
